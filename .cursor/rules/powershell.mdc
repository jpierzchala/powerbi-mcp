- You are running in Windows PowerShell. Do NOT append `| cat` to commands. If needed, use `| Out-String -Width 4096`.
- Prefer running commands without any pager or piping in PowerShell.
- Quote paths containing spaces. The workspace path includes spaces.
- Use `pytest -q` directly (no piping) to run tests.
- For background processes, use the job control provided by the environment instead of shell-specific operators.
- Avoid Unix-only tools (sed/awk/less). Use PowerShell equivalents when necessary.
